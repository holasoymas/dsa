# Differences Between Tree, Binary Tree, and Binary Search Tree

| Data Structure | Description | Properties |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| Tree | A non-linear data structure with a hierarchical relationship between its elements. It is composed of nodes, which hold data, and connections between nodes, known as edges. Each tree has a node designated as the root and the remaining nodes are partitioned into non-overlapping sets, each of which is a tree itself, known as a subtree. | No specific order. Can have any number of children nodes. |
| Binary Tree | A specific type of tree in which each node has at most two children, typically referred to as the left child and the right child. This is a specialized form of tree with two child nodes (left child and right child). It is a simple representation of data in a tree structure  | Each node can have at most two children: left and right. |
| Binary Search Tree | A binary search tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree data structure that has the following properties: The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key. The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree. | Each node can have at most two children: left and right. Left child node's key is less than the parent's key. Right child node's key is greater than the parent's key. |
